Final project of the course CS-528 Data Privacy and Security

Consist in a general DAPP of a general case use consisting in a Shopping List, which stores the information in a local blockchain, but stored using privacy method of k-anonymity, using diferent hierarchies to store the information of the food bought by the users. 

The purpose of this proyect is providing privacy to the users who store information in the blockchain by generalizing the information of the item the have bought (for example, storing Fruit instead of Banana, or Fish instead of Salmon). By doing this, the other nodes of the network (users or the enterprise who maintain the DAPP and blockchain) could access this information, but they do not know what the users have bought actually.
